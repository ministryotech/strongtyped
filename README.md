# Ministry.StrongTyped #
This project is set up to provide base classes for generating strongly typed access to traditionally simple object or string type stores, such as ASP.Net Session state and the matching interfaces and test fakes to enable simple unit testing scenarios for the same.

## Parameter Checking ##
As coders we frequently find ourselves writing the same code over and over again to check the validity of passed parameters to a method. Using the CheckParameter static class in the Ministry.StrongTyped library you can replace this...
```
#!c#
if (myParameter == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("myParameter");
```
with
```
#!c#
CheckParameter.IsNotNull(myParameter, "myParameter");
```
or, for Strings and StringBuilders, this...
```
#!c#
if (myParameter == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("myParameter");
if (myParameter == String.Empty) throw new ArgumentException("The parameter 'myParameter' cannot be empty", myParameter );
```
with
```
#!c#
CheckParameter.IsNotNullOrEmpty(myParameter, "myParameter");
```
There is also a method for passing in your own criteria matching function.

## WebSession ##
### Using Session State in your Application ###
Use a WebSessionBase class. Recommended usage is to inherit from this class in your application and use that class to access session state. You can then swap out your session wrapper with any other implementation of IWebSession to enable testing of components that previously would have been extremely hard to test because of a dependency on session state.

### Faking WebSession ###
The IWebSession interface provides an in-memory alternative to Session that can be used within your tests to remove a dependency on session state by using the IWebSession interface instead.
